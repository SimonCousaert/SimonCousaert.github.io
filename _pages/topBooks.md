## *1/ The Daily Stoic - Ryan Holiday*

I got interested in Stoicism around 2018. Since then, my humble interest in philoosphy has not ended, and I try to read about this topic from time to time. The Daily Stoic combines translations of Seneca, Epictetus, Zeno and more. The Stoic philosophy is something I truly appreciate, for its unique combination for both wisdom and practicality.


## *2/ How to win friends and influence people - Dale Carnegie*

Even though the title of this book was not very convincing to me, the content absolutely was. Written in 1936, it is still relevant and a must-read for business people. The book combines vivid stories with actionable insights, through which the reader becomes more aware of the important causes and consequences of being a good friend, partner and leader.


## *3/ What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars - Jim Paul*

I like honest books. Jim Paul's story is not about how you become successful, it's about the need of successfully handling failures that ultimately leads to triumph. The series of events are strongly linked to the financial world, which made it even more applicable to me personally.


## *4/ The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable - Nassim Nicholas Taleb*

As both a Machine Learning enthusiast and interested in the financial world, you start to realize that many analyses depend on the assumption that the future will be vastly similar to the past. A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. This books explains how almost all astonishing successes and failures are the result of such black swans, and thus extremely unpredictable. Learning how to benefit from these events opens your mind to the relevant, instead of the 'irrelevant'.
