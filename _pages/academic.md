## *Master Dissertation - Using Generative Adversarial Networks as upsampling technique*

Predicting company growth as a classification problem, using a Generative Adversarial Network to balance an imbalanced dataset. Built a tabular GAN based on a vanilla image GAN to upsample high-dimensional, business related data. Upsampling the data resulted in a significant higher F1 score compared to a baseline model without upsampled data.


## *Deep Learning - Multilayer perceptrons, Convolutional Networks, LSTM networks, Reinforcement Learning basics*

Created neural networks of different kinds with the Keras library in Python. MNIST digit dataset classification with MLP, CIFAR10 classification with CNN and predicting air pollution values with LSTM networks. 
Learned the ins and outs of Reinforcement learning. 

## *Prescriptive Analytics - Forecasting & Optimisation with Meta-heuristics*

Applied various forecasting methods (Naive models, exponential smoothing, neural networks, BATS...) to predict the number of accidents across the United States. Based on these forecasts, we optimized the placement of hospitals, subjected to accident coverage constraints. Used genetic algorithms to solve the P-median problem.


## *Analytical Customer Relationship Management - SAS Group Assignment, Cycling*

Used [SAS language](https://www.sas.com/en_be/home.html) to analyze the performance of cycling team Fassa Bortolo. Visual and statistical analysis of multiple Tour results.


## *Social media and Web Analytics - Prediction of industry performance using tweets*

Network analysis of my own twitter account and predicted the sales of major laptop brands only using tweets of these brands. 


## *Big Data - Tomorrowland Instagram Marketing analytics*

Performed advanced analysis on random sample of Tommorowland instagram posts and user comments with PySpark on the [Databricks platform](https://databricks.com/). Used regression and classification to predict the engagement rate of a post and whether a post is successful or not respectively. Transformed features with mainly NLP algorithms (TF-IDF, W2V...) and image processing.


## *Enterprise Architecture - FIG & Fujitsu Collaboration Judging Support System*

Applied the concepts of goal modelling (Business Motivation Model; i* goal model), value modelling (e3 value model), capability moddeling and business model representation (Lean Canvas model). Designed an Enterprise Architecture model in ArchiMate, a language to support the TOGAF ADM cycle.  


## *Data-driven and Robust Optimization and Simulation - Reorganisation	of	an	outpatient	department	in	a	hospital*

Built an event-based simulation of a patient scheduling scheme with Python. Analyzed the results to figure out the best scheme with given variables.
