## *Internship @ GoodGhosting - Business Developer (2020-2021)*

At Keyrock, I got acquainted with cryptocurrencies, Web3, DeFi and more blockchain related matters. The decentralized aspect of many of these applications spoke to me in a way few technologies did so far, it was truly refreshing. To build on that momentum, I was lucky enough to join [GoodGhosting](https://goodghosting.com/#/) as an intern.
