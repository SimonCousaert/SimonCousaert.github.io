Hi, 


My name is Simon. In June 2017, I got my Bachelor's degree in Business Engineering at the University of Ghent. 
In June 2020 I graduated from a Master's degree in that same field, majoring in Data Analytics.


In 2019, I started to plan my early steps in what I hope to be a career in which I can 
1. Excel on a daily level
2. Bring value to the community I am residing in, whether that is professionaly or personally
3. Do what I love


I realized that experiences abroad might pave the way to these goals, so I applied for different programs across the globe. 
I got a significant scholarship to go to the US (but was obliged to reject it because of COVID-19), and got allowed into universities in Paris and in London. 


When COVID-19 struck in February 2020, I was lucky enough to defer my admission to September 2021. For a number of reasons, I decided to do the 
[MSc in Computational Finance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-finance-msc). Combining my background in 
Business and Management with more technical skills at the faculty of Computer Science seemed like a perfect way to boost my early career. 

But, during the summer of 2020, I got involved with cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and Decentralized Finance. 
This materialized into an internship at Keyrock in late 2020: a blooming start-up that offers market making services and provides liquidity for digital assets. That interest further materialized in a position at the [UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies](http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am currently doing research about [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi) since March 2021. 
Ideally, and in line with goal 3, I got deeper into the rabbit hole of DeFi and in May 2021, I started combining that research position with freelancing in the community. I am currently working at [Vesper](https://vesper.finance/), where I do research for business development purposes, next to developping a small full web stack to make Ethereum blockchain data accessible for the broader Vesper and DeFi community. 



This site is structured as follows
- *Academic page*: A list of university-assigned projects. For now, it includes assignments during the 5-year period at Ghent University
- *On-the-side*: This page showcases a number of projects that I did, apart from obligated tasks at the University or at work.
- *Professional page*: Enumeration of jobs that I filled, as part of my professional career.
- *Top Books*: In addition to all this work-related information, I'm sharing the best books that I have been reading in recent times. 


Cheers, 


Simon
