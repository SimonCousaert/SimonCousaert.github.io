Hi, 


My name is Simon. In June 2017, I got my Bachelor's degree in Business Engineering at the University of Ghent. 
In June 2020 I graduated from a Master's degree in that same field, majoring in Data Analytics.


In 2019, I started to plan my early steps in what I hope to be a career in which I can 
1. Excel on a daily level
2. Bring value to the community I am residing in, whether that is professionaly or personally
3. Do what I love


I realized that experiences abroad might pave the way to these goals, so I applied for different programs across the globe. 
I got a significant scholarship to go to the US (but was obliged to reject it because of COVID-19), and got allowed into universities in Paris and in London. 


When COVID-19 struck in February 2020, I was lucky enough to defer my admission to September 2021. For a number of reasons, I decided to do the 
[MSc in Computational Finance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-finance-msc). Combining my background in 
Business and Management with more technical skills at the faculty of Computer Science seems like a perfect way to boost my early career. 


If all goes well, I'll be in London when Autumn 2021 starts, and I'll be enjoying the rainy days in the European financial capital. 


Interesting to know is that during the summer of 2020, I got involved with cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and Decentralized Finance. 
This materialized into an internship at Keyrock: a blooming start-up that offers market making services and provides liquidity for digital assets. That interest further materialized in a position at the [UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies](http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am currently providing assistance in research about [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi) and doing my own research in that same industry. 
Ideally, and in line with goal 3, I'll continue to combine the Master's program next year with more research into the digital asset space. 
Applying traditional finance methodologies could prove worthwhile in the intriguing world of Decentralized Finance.



This site is structured as follows
- *Academic page*: A list of university-assigned projects. For now it only includes assignments during the 5-year period at Ghent University
- *On-the-side*: This page showcases a number of projects that I did, apart from obligated tasks at the University or at work.
- *Professional page*: Enumeration of jobs that I filled, as part of my professional career. Started in 2020 during my deferral year and will continue after the MSc in London.
- *Top Books*: In addition to all this work-related information, I will share the best books that I have been reading in recent times. 


Cheers, 


Simon
