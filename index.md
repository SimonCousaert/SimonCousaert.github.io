Hi, 


My name is Simon. In June 2017, I got my Bachelor's degree in Business Engineering at the University of Ghent. 
In June 2020 I graduated from a Master's degree in that same field, majoring in Data Analytics.


In 2019, I started to plan my early steps in what I hope to be a career in which I can 
1. Excel on a daily level
2. Bring value to the employer 
3. Do what I love


I realized that experiences abroad might pave the way to these goals, so I applied for different programs across the globe. 
I got a significant scholarship to go to the US (but was obliged to reject it because of COVID-19), and got allowed into universities in Paris and in London. 


When COVID-19 struck in February 2020, I was lucky enough to defer my admission to September 2021. For a number of reasons, I decided to do the 
[MSc in Computational Finance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computational-finance-msc). Combining my background in 
Business and Management with more technical skills at the faculty of Computer Science seems like a perfect way to boost my early career. 


If all goes well, I'll be in London when Autumn 2021 starts, and I'll be enjoying the rainy days in the European financial capital. 


Interesting to know is that during the summer of 2020, I got involved with cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and Decentralized Finance. 
This materialized into an internship at Keyrock: a blooming start-up that offers market making services and provides liquidity for digital assets. 
Ideally, and in line with goal 3, I'll combine the Master's with more research into the digital asset space. 
Applying traditional finance methodologies could prove worthwhile in the intriguing world of Decentralized Finance.



This site is structured as follows
- *Academic page*: Here you'll find the projects that I did during my 5 year period at Ghent university. These projects were assigned by the university. 
- *Extracurricular page*: This page showcases a number of projects that I did, not affiliated with the university. This is what ate most of my free time back then. 
- *Professional page*: Enumeration of jobs that I filled, as part of my professional career. 
- *Top Books*: In addition to all this work-related information, I will share the best books that I have been reading in recent times. 


Cheers, 


Simon
